## Description

The vulnerability consisted on using the `openExternalUrl` functionality of the SDK via some particular smart items (WeChat social buttons). The `openExternalUrl` feature ends up calling `window.open()` on the main window, and the attacker would use a `javascript:` payload instead of a regular URL, and this javascript would be executed in the context of the main window, letting the attacker have access to read cookies, localStorage, and the DOM of the victim. Since the ephemeral private keys are stored in localStorage, this vulnerability could be used to steal them. This vulnerability was only possible to perform on Firefox though, since Chrome and Safari block the execution of `javascript:` payloads when using `window.open()`.

## Severity

Websites & Applications - High

## Solution

The fix consisted on patching the internals of the `openExternalUrl` feature in Kernel to only call `window.open()` if the url starts with `https:`. This fixed the vulnerability in-world, but it could still be exploited in the Builder, since it uses a very outdated version of the ECS, and it was not possible to upgrade it in order to fix the issue. So, to workaround this, the ECS version that the Builder uses had to be forked and patched in the bundle itself following the same logic as explained above.
