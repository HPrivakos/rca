## Description

The contract wMANA `0xd055617d7bf6b5c0e743ca0ba469591477efdf5e` has the function forward that allow you to do calls to contracts that is not depositedToken, for doing the call this uses a call script who the wmana call using a DelegateCall so maintains the context of the wMANA. Also we need to hold 1 wMANA but we can do a deposit() to get it.

The attacker can call 0x469788fE6E9E9681C6ebF3bF78e7Fd26Fc015446 (Snapshot: Delegation) and delegate all the MANA hold by the wMANA contract to do voting on the DAO (currently 30,218,494.937222222 MANA).

## Severity

Smart Contracts - Low

## Solution

We have [removed the `forward`](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc9afe8f56067cfa00b08b343eb56b581a7427cf9ec2200002c28b69a9f706f76#eventlog) function Tfrom the wMANA contract.
