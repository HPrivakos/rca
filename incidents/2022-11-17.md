## What happened?

The changes made to the avatar's wearables, username and description are not visible from the perspective of other users.

## Why did it happen?

The profile broadcast are versioned with monotonic counters to save bandwidth. There was a missing condition that ignored the new profile messages because the version field was not being considered.

## Impact

Users only see a fixed set of wearables and names (profile) of other players, not being able to see their new outfits or configurations.

## Solution

A patch was applied in this commit https://github.com/decentraland/kernel/commit/92da22b8079424802b36966f7d4eb52f3b37bc09 and rolled out to all users of the platform.
